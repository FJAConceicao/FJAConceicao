I am a full-stack developer specialized in Python for backend and Flutter for frontend development. I have experience in creating interactive websites and implementing robust APIs with Flask, managing data through MySQL. I work with agile methodologies and SCRUM, use Git for version control, and am skilled with the Google Cloud platform, which enables me to create and maintain scalable and highly available applications.

In the DevOps field, my experience extends to configuring Docker container services, optimizing operations with Portainer, and integrating tools such as Jenkins, Overleaf, OpenProject, and GitLab. I actively contribute to the construction and maintenance of pipelines for the build and CI/CD of the company's projects, using Jenkins to enhance continuous delivery processes. Furthermore, I provide support in the management of the company's physical installations, ensuring operational efficiency and security.

Before my current position, I worked at LIpE (Computer Lab for Education) at UFRJ, where I dedicated myself to software development in C++ using the Qt framework, creating administrative solutions for a state high school. I also provided support in the maintenance of computers and networks, as well as collaborated as an instructor and monitor in Python programming courses, contributing to the educational development of the students.

My career is guided by the continuous pursuit of knowledge and the practical application of acquired skills, always with the goal of delivering solutions that exceed expectations and meet the complex needs of the market.
